# HRTReminder

haii this is my personal program to remind me to take my girl pills awa
this was never supposed to be a serious project and idk if better reminder programs exist on Windows but idrc
also there's no releases cuz I didn't implement a way to set your own dose times so it would just have my own ones

# How to use
- clone the repo (or just download master just as long as you have the .sln file idk how github works i'm not a programmer)
- open the .sln file
- edit the times to your own ones (it doesn't have to be 3 it can be as many as you need)
- optional: change the alert sound (its in reminder.vb) to anything you want (by default its gonna try to play "ambatukam.wav" located in C:\a\)
- optional: edit the messagebox text that shows up after you confirm you took your HRT (by default its set to "good girl! keep it up <3")
- build the exe and add it to the startup folder (win+r -> shell:startup)
